# CodePath Intermediate Web Development Portfolio

This repository contains my projects, experiments, and learning outputs from the **10-week CodePath Intermediate Web Development Program**. Each week builds progressively on core frontend concepts such as React components, props, state, styling, data-driven UI, and interactive application design.

### Week 1: Timetable
Built a weekly timetable interface that displays days, times, and scheduled events using reusable React components.
Expanded beyond the base lesson by implementing **template-driven rendering** and dynamically filling the page using `posts.map`-style data mapping.

**Tech & Concepts Learned:**
* React component structure and planning
* Props for passing structured data into components
* Mapping arrays to UI (`.map`) for scalable rendering
* Layout thinking for real interfaces (calendar grid mindset)
